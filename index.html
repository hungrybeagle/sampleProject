	//Javascript
	document.getElementById("div1").innerHTML = "This was changed, like assigning a variable";
	$("#div2").html("This was changed using function parameters");
	//notice the use of the selector "$()" and the contents of the selector indicate what to change.
	
	// JQuery has options for far more selections than just IDs
	// You can use any element, and ALL of the elements of the same type are changed.
	$("div").css("color","red");
	
	// You can specificy a class using the .  and all of the classes with the same name will be changed.
	$(".class1").css("background-color","blue");
	
	// You can combine classes, id's and element names to get more specific
	$("div.class1").html("Only div's that have a 'class1' property will be changed");
